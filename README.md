# SCV-List

This list highlights the accomplishments and disclosed vulnerabilities of the top white hat security experts in DeFi.

This list is part HackerOne leaderboard and part CVE database. Contributions are welcome and it would be amazing if the crypto community could crowdsource a CVE-like database. My arbitrary rules to include a vulnerability in this list (until I am convinced otherwise) is that the vulnerability must be discovered on mainnet (meaning most audit findings are excluded) and it must not have resulted in intentional loss of user funds (meaning most rekt.news hacks are excluded).

So far, the sources of this list include postmortems from:
- [Immunefi’s Medium posts](https://medium.com/immunefi)
- [samczsun’s research](https://samczsun.com/research/)
- [Yearn Finance security disclosures](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/tree/master/disclosures)
- [Blockthreat newsletter](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/)
- Immunefi Discord bugfix-reviews channel
- Assorted vulnerabilities from CT
- [Similar github list](https://github.com/sayan011/Immunefi-bug-bounty-writeups-list)

Additional submissions to fill in gaps are welcome.

## What about common code weaknesses?

This list only includes actual vulnerabilities. There are CWE-like lists that exist to capture common weaknesses in code, including these lists:
- https://swcregistry.io/
- https://securing.github.io/SCSVS/
- https://github.com/sigp/solidity-security-blog

## What about hacks that cause protocols to get rekt?

This list does not include black hat hacks which involved user loss of funds, even if the funds are returned. There are other lists for that, including these lists:
- https://rekt.news/
- https://hacked.slowmist.io/
- https://cryptosec.info/defi-hacks/
- https://github.com/jwparktom/GutteDeFi

## What about Layer 1 blockchain vulns

This list is focused on smart contract vulnerabilities. Some layer 1 vulnerabilities may be included below, but there are separate lists for this topic
- https://github.com/ethereum/public-disclosures/blob/master/disclosures/EL.md

## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome. This list is guaranteed to be incomplete.

## This markdown table format is weird...

Yes, it renders weird on github, but you can view the markdown in your own local markdown editor instead of github. Or you can search for a web-based markdown-to-csv converter and copy the data to a spreadsheet.
